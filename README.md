# 🌗 Glassmorphism Theme Switcher (Light / Dark Mode)

This project is a modern animated theme switcher built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed with a combination of glassmorphism and neumorphism UI principles. It provides a smooth and visually pleasing transition between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

The toggle uses CSS variables to dynamically update colors across the interface, making it extremely easy to scale and integrate into any website or web application. The animated sun and moon icons, bouncy knob movement, and subtle glow effects enhance the overall user experience.
